	  </div>
			<div id="our-mission">
				<p> Through themed events that raise awareness to current issues, Soulstice aims to engage the whole Bay Area community in the world of art as activism. Specifically, Soulstice actively works to invite the surrounding communities of color, which may lack representation and exposure to the art world. Our events and future projects aim to support small business entrepeneuers and bring forth the discussion of current issues through art. Our vision is to create accessible safe spaces and affordable creative expression.  </p>

	<div id="subtitle2"><h4>OUR STORY</h4>
	  </div>
			<div id="our-story">
				<p> In 2019, affected by the devastating fires damaging the Bay Area community, and inspired by our passion for art and creativity, we began planning our first show, "Smoke in My Eyez". We welcomed 250 guests for a night of love and activism for our planet, celebrating with local artists, performers, and vendors. Soulstice was officially founded in June 2019, and we have continued to expand our platform and throw shows for various social justice causes and organizations. </p>
